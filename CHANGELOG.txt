pictualizer v0.6.0 - updated 9/3/13
===================================

 * new image copying algorithm - massive FPS/performance gain

 * implemented a moving average on the FFT bars - much smoother animation now

 * added a log() on top of FFT-processed amplitudes

 * adjusted bar & FFT frequency ranges to the following:

   - LOW: 0 - 450 Hz
   
   - MID: 450 - 1350 Hz
   
   - HIGH: 1350 - 2400 Hz

 * removed additional junk global variables in pictualizer.pde

 * rewrote some GUI code for better performance & readability

 * added MenuStates & AudioStates to hold state/control related constants for main program,

   since processing doesn't allow java enums!


 **** WIP ****
 
 * rewrite all GUI code in pictualizer.pde for better readability & performance

 * fix incorrect GUI text placement due to new controlP5 library

 * add new GUI design + changes, including album art display (requires custom ID3 tag reader)

 * fixing A LOT of bugs; just feeling too lazy to write them all down!

 * expecting big changes in the future, but slow progress due to school currently :(
