Pictualizer is a drag and drop music visualizer programmed using Processing, an open source programming language. The core concept behind 'pictualizer' is to generate an aesthetic music visualization experience for each individual's own tastes. Thus, any individual can drag and drop their own pictures and songs into 'pictualizer' and have their music visualized.

Pictualizer was started during July 2012.
