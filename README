Pictualizer is a drag and drop music visualizer programmed using Processing, an open source programming language.
It is being developed as a music player with a focus on sleek and appealing music visualization.

Pictualizer was started during July 2012.

Open source Processing libraries used:

ControlP5 - by Andreas Schlegel
Minim - by Damien Di Fede
SDrop - by Andreas Schlegel

The source code is currently undergoing a major re-write, as of 12/1/13.

Have a video of it in action! (old version, the current version is coming along a lot better.)
